I made a website with my blog posts about my favorite episodes of my favorite series and I just used html and Css. Since I tried resppponsive design for the first time, I created a design with responsive design on my blog pages, though not on every page. You can review the website online from the Add section.

<h4 style="color: #94d2bd;"> BLACK MIRROR </h4>

- A British science fiction anthology series created by Charlie Brooker. The series discovers the dark and often dystopian aspects of modern technology and society. Each chapter contains an independent story that examines human behavior, relationships, and possible consequences of technological advances across society.

- The series name "Black Mirror" ( Black Mirror) refers to the reflective screens of our devices such as smartphones, tablets and televisions. These devices, which are generally thought to reflect the darker aspects of society when we interact with technology, form the basic theme of the series. The series is famous for its thought-provoking and often spooky stories that emphasize the ethical and moral consequences of our growing dependence on technology.

<h2 style="color: #0081a7;"> Lessons Learned </h2>


HTML and CSS are two vital technologies in creating modern internet experiences. HTML is used to specify the structural components of web pages. CSS is used to determine the visual design of web pages. However, HTML and CSS are not sufficient in web site design. They just create simple levels of web requests and generally become designd setters. Javascript, php and framework should be used for the more advanced web request. 

Concepts such as Responsive design (sensitive design ) also emerge. This is an improved approach to ensure that web pages are displayed properly on different devices and screen sizes. I had a little trouble giving this feature to my code, I have to improve myself.
