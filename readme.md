#### My Blog about Favorite TV Series Episodes

This project showcases my journey into creating a personal blog where I share my thoughts and reviews on my favorite episodes from beloved TV series. As a beginner in web development, I relied on HTML and CSS to bring this blog to life. While I experimented with responsive design for the first time, I must admit that not every page on my blog is fully responsive. 

### Project Highlights:

- HTML and CSS Usage: I've utilized HTML and CSS to create a visually appealing and content-rich blog that allows me to express my passion for TV series.

- Responsive Design: Despite being new to responsive design, I've implemented it in certain sections of my blog to ensure that the content looks great on various devices and screen sizes.
  
- I wrote the blogs in their entirety: Feel free to explore my blog and read my articles about my favorite TV series episodes. While not every page is responsive, I've put effort into creating an engaging reading experience.

<h4 style="color: #94d2bd;"> BLACK MIRROR </h4>

- A British science fiction anthology series created by Charlie Brooker. The series discovers the dark and often dystopian aspects of modern technology and society. Each chapter contains an independent story that examines human behavior, relationships, and possible consequences of technological advances across society.

- The series name "Black Mirror" ( Black Mirror) refers to the reflective screens of our devices such as smartphones, tablets and televisions. These devices, which are generally thought to reflect the darker aspects of society when we interact with technology, form the basic theme of the series. The series is famous for its thought-provoking and often spooky stories that emphasize the ethical and moral consequences of our growing dependence on technology.

<h2 style="color: #0081a7;"> Lessons Learned </h2>

HTML and CSS are two essential technologies for creating modern web experiences. HTML is used to specify the structural components of web pages. CSS is used to specify the visual design of web pages. However, HTML and CSS are not sufficient for website design. They only create simple layers of web requests and generally become design setters. Javascript, php and frameworks should be used for more advanced web requirements. 

Concepts such as responsive design are also emerging. This is an improved approach to ensuring that web pages are displayed correctly on different devices and screen sizes. I had a bit of trouble getting my code to do this, I need to get better at it.
