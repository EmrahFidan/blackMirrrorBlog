            LThis is the story of 2 people looking for a true love, Frank and
            Amy. When it comes to searching, we use technology. There is an
            application called Aries. This application is an application for
            searching for true love, People present to this virtual assistant
            where to go, where to meet Dec. They seem to have entrusted their
            own fate to him down to the smallest detail. The food they eat, even
            the duration of their relationship, is predetermined. The coach
            accompanies them to the house where they will live and then they
            leave them on their own. So even in such a system, they have their
            own free will.

            options that may be most suitable for them with the data collected.
            As a result, the system is able to make a match that suits you with

            Our couple meet in a party even though the system does not match
            them, 2.time. There is a very high wall around the area where they
            live, a border, it seems impossible to get out of the system, to get
            out of this life. You have to live in that world. You have to learn
            from everything that happens to you, because everything happens for
            a reason. At parties, if the DJ starts playing bad music, the
            audience starts saying it, that's where the phrase comes from. It is
            generally available for people who manage music, manage a band,
            offer something to people, but do it according to their own taste
            and without caring about others.

            Then our couple gets back together, Dec 3.once, but this time
            with system mapping. By the way, one of them had a single
            relationship for a long time, and the other had a lot of short-term
            relationships. Dec. When they meet again after all this experience,
            they decide not to look at the countdown machine. So they start
            living without knowing how long it will last. Everything must be
            going well for our couple, who really like each other, but Frank,
            overcome with curiosity, wants to check how much time they have
            left, and here's what's happening. Although the system says that
            their duration was 5 years at first, it starts to decrease every
            second, and eventually there are 20 hours left.(as an explanation,
            he says that the unilateral review has destabilized the period. )
            Because one of the parties has betrayed the feeling of trust between
            them in this relationship, and then they start new experiences
            again. Dec.

            Finally, the system says that it has found the ideal match and also
            states that it can say goodbye to one of its former relationships
            before meeting him. In this case our pair is 4. once they get
            together and look at how long they have left, 1 minute and 24
            seconds...that's when they make a decision, “I don't care about the
            system, I want you. Dec.” They made their own choices. this world is
            a test for us, and they think that if we rebel against the ba system
            together, we can pass this test.They start running away, trying to
            jump off the wall. It means not accepting the limits set by this
            system for them, not submitting to authority.

            they made the final decisions, and suddenly the world around them
            stopped. There were no barriers anymore. Until everything was a
            simulation, the episode we watched was the 998th simulation. This
            couple loved each other so much that they rebelled against the
            system in 998 out of 1000 simulations. 99.8% match.So, as you can
            see, the world created by the system was nothing more than a mobile
            application. In theory, what happens if we upload not only our
            photos to this system, but all we know, our thoughts, that is,
            everything that makes us who we are ? If everyone does this, not
            just us, and our avatars are Decoupled together in the virtual world
            1000 times.

            Maybe that's what a soul mate is called. What you have found many
            times, maybe you think you have found, you are not sure... you do
            not know whether you are in 998 out of 1000 simulations or in the 2
            that did not rebel and remained in the simulation... The only thing
            we know is that the life software has placed unnaturally, absurdly
            large obstacles in front of you. Time, distance, different cultures,
            different cities, different views of life, etc. Overcoming these
            obstacles is a separate problem, what will happen after overcoming
            them is different... But what if we are asked to jump over the wall
            hand in hand, not just looking behind us and in front of us? Then if
            we are going to wake up from this simulation and meet in reality?

            Charlie Brooker is here giving the audience and society the middle
            finger to our understanding of relationships. Amy says that
            throughout your life, you've been drifting from relationship to
            relationship with an algorithm imposed on you by society's
            established value judgments in order to find the right person. He
            tries, he makes mistakes, he gets upset, and every time you either
            become more fragile or more emotionless. Eventually, you get tired
            and marry the person the ”system“ calls you ”this is the right
            person in your life" because you no longer have the strength to
            handle any more relationships. You say that's it, and you give
            yourself reasonable excuses. The wedding scene in the series is a
            scene that describes very well the fact that a person can convince
            himself. We are able to convince ourselves that the “right person”
            that the system has found for us is the person that we are really
            looking for, that we want, that excites us when we hold his
            hand.When we get to the point of divorce or separation, we realize
            that we are trying to convince ourselves, we are trying to deceive
            ourselves, and we are not making an effort to get out of the system.

            Let's say we're in a test right now, as Amy mentioned. As he says at
            the end of the episode, “this is a test”... the algorithm we call
            life matches us with someone, and even most matches happen with
            people we never wanted. We constantly ask ourselves the question:
            "Why am I with someone like this? Why did I choose this?..." Every
            association provides us with an experience and we learn something
            more about ourselves. But deep down we are always looking for that
            ultimate person. The one who will complete us. When you ask
            yourself, the answer that comes from you is that this is love, a
            desire for completion beyond love, you get the answer. When you find
            that person, you don't know how to know if he is the right person,
            because there is no math, there are no rules. You just hold her hand
            like Amy does in the show and observe your feelings.

            In a nutshell, you are in such a world. What is being asked of you
            is actually simple: find the person you will love so much that you
            will have the courage to get out of this world at all costs, to go
            beyond the wall. Let this be such a person that when you are with
            him, do not look at the clock. Don't think about the time. Stay in
            the moment. Do not look at your future, your past. Do not focus on
            how long the relationship will last and be willing to get out of the
            simulation, i.e. the endless loop, despite all the obstacles you
            face.
