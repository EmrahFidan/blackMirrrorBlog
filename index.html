            Cinema, which has been likened to Plato's cave allegory, allows the
            realization of reality. According to this allegory given by Plato in
            the book of State; "Underground is a cave-like place, there are
            people in it. an entrance that opens to the full-length light in
            front. People have been chained by their feet and necks since
            childhood, they live in this cave. The knowledge of the truth can
            only be reached outside the cave. In the light of this allegory, the
            people sitting on the seats in the cinema are likened to the people
            in the cave, the fire in the cave is the projection, and the objects
            and puppets played in front of the fire are compared to the
            storyboard. In the light of this interpretation, the images
            projected on the screen in the cinema are not the truth itself; the
            real message can only be understood by "becoming aware and
            conscious" of the images in the cinema. The British television
            series "Black Mirror" has been airing in the style of drama,
            adventure, satire and science fiction since 2011, with a different
            cast, different location and even a different perception of reality
            in each episode.

            Charlie Brooker, the executive producer of the series, said, "Each
            episode is about our current lifestyle and what we can experience in
            10 minutes if we are rude." Charlie Brooker, who says that there is
            something that this series does in general, holding a mirror to our
            lives that does not tell us how beautiful we are, but shows our dark
            sides, points to the zenophobia in us and makes us aware of the
            forces that decide what we can see and what we cannot see, Charlie

            The dystopian stories presented in the different episodes of the
            series deal with the new ethical and moral problems that have arisen
            with the progress of technology. Thanks to these perspectives,
            viewers have the opportunity to question their selves and
            personalities. Behind many of the chapters lie great philosophical
            views. However, it can also be seen that the series shows a negative
            perspective on the endless pursuit of scientific and technological
            progress. Most of the episodes end unhappily. The first 2 seasons of
            the series were broadcast on TV4, and the subsequent seasons were
            broadcast on Netflix. Let's examine the contents of the sections now :
