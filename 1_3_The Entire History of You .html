              >The reflection metaphor</a

            indicates that the character is in a dilemma. He is being asked to
            look into retrospective family cases. In law, this is used in the
            sense of covering the past. so the series tells us the subject from
            the very beginning.

            What happened to the man is due to what will happen to him and his
            wife. The problem of who belongs to the child in the family, which
            is shown 1 or 2 times during the series, forms the skeleton of the
            series.This is called the irony of circumstance

            Thanks to the chip placed behind the ears, it is processed so that
            people can see their history again on the screen or in front of
            their own eyes. Something like GBT. So if you're going to be
            accepted by Jul, your past has to be clean. You don't have a chance
            to lie, unwanted memories can be erased, but it means that the past
            is being manipulated because it creates a gap in the record.

            The moments in the past are one time, there is no repetition, but
            this chip that people use in this series takes them back to the past
            and interprets their memories. Our man who watches the interview
            moment again listens to their sentences again and realizes how
            insincere they are. In THESE same religious teachings, there are
            souls of the hereafter, and after people die, the evil they have
            done in the other world is revealed, their sins are shown and their
            account is asked.Our man suspected that his wife was close to a
            friend. Is the truth in the moment, or is it in the past, acab, we
            humans are drowning in thoughts of the past because we can't catch
            the truth in the moment.Later, someone without a chip comes to the
            house parties, the person named Helen says that she has used it
            before and then relaxes. Do you really think a person relaxes when
            he gets rid of his past ?

            At the party, a woman named Canon, who is one of the developers of
            this chip, says that most of our memory is filled with unnecessary
            things. You can upload fake memories to a person's brain by asking
            questions in therapy. You can leave people somewhere they've never
            been before, worrying about someone who hasn't been before. These
            explanations actually reveal the risk in people's perception of the
            past as real. So the past of your real chest may be a fabrication.
            Questioning the past, they do nothing but read it over and over and
            try to make sense of it. Almost no one in the show can live their
            moment. In the sequel, the man reveals his wife's secret affair. In
            doing so, he uses all his professional experience. He even tells his
            wife that you're a bitch sometimes. His wife rewinds the same word
            and makes our man listen to it again, but sometimes he ignores the
            word when he listens to it. He says you can't make out the word
            bzaen. Here, truth is such a delicate thing that sometimes it
            depends on a single word. Sometimes to the mimic movement, sometimes
            to the intonation.

            It is not clear what our man will do when he finds out that his wife
            is no longer faithful to him. The bathroom scene is like an
            interrogation. His double image in front of the mirror is a great
            visual symbol that shows the dilemma he is living in himself.
            Because in movies, the mirror is used to show that the character has
            a double personality or is in a dilemma. The character who is
            looking at the mirror comes face to face with his ego, of course,
            this interpretation is one of the meanings of the mirror image. The
            guy will go and apologize right after this scene. Mirrors add depth
            to the characters.

            When our communication distance between people is violated, there is
            definitely Deconfliction between people. We can also tell this from
            the lip readings in the section.Out of ambition, he goes to the
            house of the man whose wife cheated on him and threatens him and
            tells him to erase his wife's past. some time after watching the man
            who erased his past, the scene is skipped and our hero finds himself
            in a car accident. Then our guy uses the chip to find out what
            happened. He regrets the threat he made, and this is the scene where
            he gets rid of the fiction of the past, reaches his own reality, and
            goes in search of identity. He's probably wondering if he's the
            father of her child.

            Our character soon realizes that there is a lie in the fake family
            he is in. He will understand this fact from a small detail that he
            sees at the moment of threat. Exactly 18 months ago, you were his
            wife, and when he found out that this man was sleeping in their bed,
            there is a high probability that this man is the father of the
            child. The truth is discovered thanks to a picture on the wall, that
            is, a work of art. In a sense, he is like a guide who leads a person
            thanks to an art that shows his reality in all the lies that people
            live.

            Our man who forcibly looks at the recording sees that the man he was
            cheated on with did not use a condom, so he realizes that the child
            is from him. There is a family, but Liam is no longer a member of
            this family. The series also shows the rottenness of technology in
            domestic and extramarital personal relationships. Then Liam rips the
            chip out of his neck and throws it away. This tool is not a tool
            that records the past, it is a tool that makes you forget the
            present.Technological developments are always considered
            forward-looking, but this chip confines a person to the past. Are we
            becoming slaves of the past when we want to be the god of the
            present?
