            There is a saying in English in this section, “you can't see the
            forest because of the trees”, you are in the problem, but you can't
            realize what the problem is. The episode begins with Bing sleeping
            in a room surrounded by digital screens. A rooster appears on the
            screen and starts crowing. This scene is a small representation of
            us who have moved away from real life and stuck to artificial life.
            When the character wakes up, digital sensors recognize that he has
            woken up and show him the amount of digital credits. Everything he
            does has a financial reward, they even pay a loan for toothpaste.

            Suddenly an erotic advertisement, which we call spam, appears in the
            mirror and you are given only 2 options, either watch it or turn off
            the view. If he chooses to close, he must pay off the loan. So
            you're paying the price for something you're not watching, which is
            one of the most damaging parts of the dystopian world.

            Then the main character enters an area where there are bicycles,
            this part is where there are workers employed to generate
            electricity. They get a loan by riding bicycles here and use this
            loan in their lives. People spend their lives watching the screens
            that surround them. How many screens are there in your workplace,
            doesn't your life go by looking at them? People even choose their
            food from digital media. When you choose an apple, another spam ad
            appears on the screen because those who like apples also like
            bananas. An example of the ads we encounter in our daily lives.

            real thing here must be the apple. The first sin arising from this
            adam and Eve story includes the meanings of passion and ambition.
            The story of the expulsion from heaven is used here as the first
            occasion of the exit from hell. Even apple means love and sexuality
            in secular art. The woman here is none other than Aphrodite.
            Aphrodite is a goddess identified with the apple and there are a lot
            of statues of her in this way. Aphrodite is referred to as Venus in
            Roman mythology, even her full name is venus verticordia, in the
            sense of changing hearts. It shows that we have given up on human
            virtues at this point.

            After the work is over, Bing, who has no other options, spends time
            playing games in his room, and here he comes across an advertisement
            for a talent contest. Participating in this competition and winning
            is the only way to get out of this environment. But there is a
            striking situation in the same scene. George Orwell takes us back to
            his 1984 novel. There is also this

            who watches everyone and everything in this series. The moment the
            man is not looking at the screen, the system detects it and sends a
            warning. The imposed video is a sex scene. If the man does not watch
            this, he will lose the right.

            One day Bing meets Abi in the toilet, the only thing that seems real
            to him here is her singing, and his first job is to rescue this
            woman he is in love with from that environment. For this reason, he
            offers Abi to participate in a talent contest and tells her, “Let
            something real happen now,” while giving her her own credit. At that
            time, all the bicycle flippers on the stage are displayed as if they
            were a factory. This is an indication of how artificial this mass
            exploitation is.

            While the jury of the competition is being introduced in the series,
            the series defines the steps of class distinction with this jury
            representing the upper class. The upper class who live in luxury,
            the middle class who live a monotonous life, and the lower class who
            do not use bicycles because they are overweight and are given a
            cleaning task. Contestants have to drink a narcotic liquid before
            going on stage. This liquid, which forces you to be trusting, is a
            symbol that shows the grievances of other classes who are
            indifferent to the commands of the upper class. - The names of the
            jury describe the qualities of those who decide people's fate :
            Charity : charity, Hope: hope, Wraith: there is a ghost. Your
            woman's next life will move along the path promised by the ghost.
            Although the jury likes the woman, she gives him another option due
            to the fact that there are too many contestants in the song
            category. Wraith has a porn streaming channel. He wants her to work
            here. The woman becomes indifferent to this offer under the
            influence of drugs and accepts. The guy will object, but they will
            take him away from there. There is a patriarchal situation in all
            classes that the array parses. Women are shown as sex objects of
            men. There is even a female figure in the juries who sees life from
            a male-oriented center.

            A sad scene of the episode : While the man is in his room, a porn ad
            appears as spam, this time there is a woman he is in love with on
            the channel. He doesn't want to see her, he can't skip the ad
            because he doesn't have enough credits left to pass the ad, and he
            wants to break the screen by having a crisis there because the
            screen contains a sensor that is sensitive to her looking at it. In
            order to get rid of the ads that appear in your life,you need to
            take it to the level of consciousness. If you don't, those ads will
            continue to appear in your world. It is the outward expression of
            the internal trauma of us people in the crisis that the man is
            experiencing. Later, the man wants to save the girl from that world,
            so he collects credits by pedaling day and night, and eventually
            participates in the competition. On stage, he threatens the jury to
            kill himself and expresses all his true thoughts.

            Jury fed these statements to the middle class as if they were just a
            show, and Hope gave Bing a false hope. This time jury Hope offers
            him to do a program on his own channel. Surprisingly, he accepts
            this. And Bing gave up his honor, his love, his revolution in the
            name of money and false hope.So the character went against the
            system, but he didn't insist on it. Just like us, we keep saying
            that the capitalist system is very bad, but none of us are doing
            anything, we are all waiting for someone to come out and destroy
            this system. We also see that Bing does not drink a drug drink
            before going on stage, so he is free to choose, but he submits to
            the force.

            There's no natural forest in the last scene, it's a screen.It's just
            bigger and the ads don't appear.So Bing's house room has grown up,
            but even worse, the character is working as a helper to this system
            this time, so while he used to be a slave to the system, now he is
            both a slave to the system and helps the system grow.How is it that
            cyclists watch this guy while riding a bike and they give it their
            right(to what they say), but they don't do anything like us
            either.They just take the gas and keep pedaling like us after the
            video ends.A vicious cycle in which everyone uses each other as
            pawns, showing that even personal love is easily sacrificed for the
            sake of interests , our self-alienation is not because we are
            avatars in games, but because we are the avatar.
