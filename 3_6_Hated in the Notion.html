            When we go to the ADI company, we see that the project has been

            on their own, without needing to be managed by someone. They have
            even created hives where they can copy themselves. It's like a 3D

            What our victims had in common was that they were both the people
            who got the most names in the patient game. The game is expanding.

            name, he'll be the one who gets defamed. The most popular target
            will be eliminated after 17.00 and the game starts again at
            midnight. They are trying to identify our third victim to the
            detection position and save him, but the hacker has taken over all
            the hives and is using all the bees to kill the victim.

            It turns out that the ADI can make identification using face

            asked for all access permits for themselves, there are cameras in
            all adis, and with these cameras, the government monitors everyone.
            Of course, there are positive aspects, many crimes can be prevented
            early, but in reality, they are watching everyone.
