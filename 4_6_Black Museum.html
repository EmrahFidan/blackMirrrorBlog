            This episode takes place in a museum, as it will be obvious from the
            name, the Black Museum. A black museum full of criminological items,
            where every item is involved in a crime, containing evidence that
            people have succumbed to their motives, shedding light on the dark
            side of humanity, questioning concepts such as pain, happiness,
            longing, cruelty, justice, human, filled with criminal objects. A
            museum that shows the dark side of humanity through a "Black
            Mirror”.

            This section appears as 3 stories, 1 story and a series of events
            belonging to the dark world of humanity. The whole story; It
            strikingly describes a chain of events that seem to be independent
            of each other, but actually develop chronologically and with a kind
            of butterfly effect.Technologically, a critical approach has been
            carried out with a wide-ranging perspective by presenting the
            problems that 3 chains of inventions, such as sense
            transfer-consciousness transfer-consciousness survival, can lead to.

            The beginning of the episode begins with a young girl traveling in a
            barren land with her car. He pulls his car to the gas station and
            sets up his car to charge with sunlight by removing the
            technological car charger in the way we are used to in the Black
            Mirror style, but since it shows a charging time of about 3 hours,
            he starts navigating. It is next to the World-famous Rolo Haynes
            Land Museum. He knocks on the door, but no one answers. He walks
            around the building, then Rolo, the owner of the museum, opens the
            door. The girl says that it's her father's birthday and he lives
            here, so he passed by here, Rolo looks for the girl's bag, and it's
            okay, now the museum tour will start.Even at the entrance of the
            museum, it is indicated that all the stories of the Black Mirror
            anthology take place in the same utopian universe. The main
            character of the White Bear episode " Child Killer" is on the screen
            at the museum entrance with his written photo. There are dozens of
            criminological items in the museum; Items such as the human costume
            with a rifle in the White Bear episode, the smart bee in the Hated
            in Nation episode, the bloody tablet on which the girl hit her
            mother in the Crocodile episode, the device Deciphering
            consciousness from DNA in the USS Calister episode are also in the
            museum.

            The first story: Rolo, the museum owner, was working at a university
            hospital as a medical technologist at that time and, in his own
            words, he was working for senior people ”. Dawson, a doctor who has
            sworn to help people, gets into great sadness when he loses a
            patient because he doesn't know the symptoms. Rolo comes to the
            doctor with an offer. He says that he can serve patients better
            thanks to a technological apparatus that allows him to experience
            the suffering of others without harming himself, and Dawson agrees
            without hesitation.

        <div class="text-box">
          <p class="text">
            On top of this, with the apparatus attached to Dawson, Dawson treats
            patients successfully and quickly by feeling the patients' pain and
            establishing a pain-symptom-diagnosis library in his mind. However,
            Dawson succumbs to his motives, first becoming addicted to pleasure.
            Later, he witnesses the moment of death of a patient and experiences
            this feeling until the marrow. After he came to himself, he is no
            longer the same man, he has become addicted to the feeling of pain
            because he has experienced death and pain without fear of death.
            Even when Dawson was having a relationship with his girlfriend, he
            was no longer looking for pleasure, but to achieve pleasure by
            experiencing pain. Dawson constantly tries to experience his pain
            next to patients in the hospital, but waiting to experience the pain
            causes the death of a patient and he is distracted from his task.
            Dawson begins to harm himself at home, but he can't take the
            pleasure in the patients' pain. Because; a suffering person
            experiences a different kind of pain due to the fear of death,
            helplessness and the awfulness of the unknown, but Dawson cannot
            experience people's pain on his own because of the fact that he is
            not harmed from the outside and in any way. Dawson chooses a victim
            for himself and kills him with a drill just to get a taste of pain,
            he enters vegetative life from the pleasure of pain.

              >Pain:</a
            >
            When we look at the history of the world, if we look at the top
            emotions present in all humanity, they are Love-Hate and
            Pleasure-Pain. In love, it contains longing, compassion, compassion
            and all beautiful feelings. It should be the basis of human life.
            Hatred, on the other hand, is the seed of hatred, arrogance, anger,
            cruelty and all similar emotions. Pleasure is the feeling of
            pleasure that human beings get from most of the things they are
            motivated by; It is the feeling that is taken from eating,
            traveling, sleeping, sexuality and similar activities and is often
            the feeling that we are always looking for in our Juniors. a person
            easily becomes addicted to pleasure. However, the feeling that
            people are most uncomfortable with is pain. A person suffers in
            physical or moral damages and incidents that are experienced. Only
            those who suffer at that moment know well, the consequences of pain
            are very diverse in the person who experiences pain. It leads to
            despair, helplessness, fear. A person avoids pain if he is not
            psychologically troubled. From the outside looking in, it's easy to
            talk about someone else's pain, it's easy to comment, it's easy to
            measure and compare it. However, the one who experiences the real
            pain knows, experiences. What makes pain scary is the reaction of
            the human brain when it feels pain. Pain; Whether it is physical or
            spiritual, it is an emotion that cannot be weighed, discussed,
            compared. Only the living know pain.

            Medical Technology: Especially 1. And 2. After the World War II, due
            to millions of injuries, deaths, diseases and similar conditions,
            mankind had to advance evolutionarily and revolutionarily in
            medicine. As a result, perhaps hundreds of years ago, people got rid
            of small or large diseases with techniques that people could call
            "sorcerers”, bringing the disabled back to life with prosthetics,
            surgeries, machines, revolution and evolution took place in the
            medical world.But as can be seen in this short story, medicine no
            longer serves humanity, but humanity serves medicine. Hundreds of
            thousands of cancer patients are losing their lives because drugs
            are not supplied by the states, drugs cannot be found, or the found
            drugs are too expensive, hundreds of thousands of leukemia patients
            are waiting for a bone marrow transplant, while states can legislate
            everything like taxes, why don't they do practices that promote bone
            marrow transplantation, blood transfusion, people aren't
            curious.While thousands of people in the world are rich, thousands
            of people are losing their lives just because medicines are
            expensive or cannot be found. The medical sector and technology are
            no longer aiming at treatment, but rather at profit, just like a
            commercial company. For example; Let's consider the MRI machines
            that have revolutionized medical technology, it is necessary to wait
            in line for months to get an MRI in a public hospital, while in a
            private hospital it is expensive to shoot for those who do not have
            a condition. I think there is a world order in which we have lost
            our humanity at this stage when humanity has arrived and are now
            considered only as customers in every respect within the capitalist
            system.

            After the narration of the criminological object that provides this
            sensory transmission, Rolo moves on to another object. After Dawson
            went insane, neuro-technological research did not stop, Rolo's team
            found a way to transfer deceased consciousnesses by advancing the
            technology that provides sensory transmission. Rolo continues to
            sweat and the black girl gives him water, Rolo drinks the water and
            starts telling the "saddest story” in the museum through a teddy
            bear. 2.story: The sense transfer in the first story has turned into
            consciousness transfer. Two young people have fallen in love, they
            have children, they are very happy, and a man and a woman want to
            take pictures of a woman playing in the park with their children,
            she gets hit by a car and falls into a coma. Rolo again appears at
            their head with an offer and says that there is a telmology that can
            place the woman's consciousness in the man's consciousness and keep
            it alive. The man accepts immediately. With this telmological
            device, a living prototype is created as a "subject” by taking
            advantage of the father's desperation and longing.

            Although a man loves his lost wife very much, after a certain point
            things get complicated and uncomfortable arguments arise.. Two

            loves, no one can live in the same body.

            cannot be considered only as an object. It is
            consciousness,spirit,character,emotions, silhouette and body that
            make a person human. A man who tries to move on with his life finds
            himself in arguments that he can no longer stand, and he becomes
            unable to have a relationship with anyone else. He knocks on Rolo's
            door again, Rolo says that they have developed a technology that can
            transfer human consciousness into a teddy bear. Now human
            consciousness has become a toy in the hands of medical telmology and
            industry. Human consciousness should be able to act with the
            guidance of consciousness. What makes a person a human being is the
            decisions he makes with his motives and consciousness and his life.

            Two concepts stand out in this story: Consciousness and Longing.
            Consciousness: what distinguishes man from other living beings is
            undoubtedly consciousness. A utopian world full of robots that look
            just like humans in the series Westworld, Anthony Hopkins gave place
            to a very appropriate aphorism: God's gift to man he said that there
            is consciousness, that what separates a robot from a human is that
            it has no consciousness, that there is consciousness at the center
            of the maze, that is, at the center of everything, that is,
            throughout the entire series.

          <p class="text">
            Longing: Longing is eternal. They say time is the cure for
            everything, it's a lie. The longing never ends, it does not
            decrease. Because longing comes from love. And love is from God.
            Love and consciousness are God's greatest gift to us. In this short
            story, a person who has lost his beloved takes the consciousness of
            the person he loves for himself because of his longing and love,
            without knowing what has happened or will happen. Although he
            argues, his longing never ends, even at the most uncomfortable
            moment, he cannot afford to completely erase it. Because even though
            the consciousness of it is not in us, we keep our loved ones alive
            in our own consciousness, we love and miss them.

            After this story, Rolo begins to tell m the "most important part "

            fired from the place where he worked because of the "teddy bear”
            issue, he didn't even get his compensation. The idea of opening the
            museum came to his mind and he started filling the museum. The third

            the death penalty. Rolo knocks on this person's door and visits him
            in prison. He says that he works in the field of medical technology
            and has an offer. The defendant asks if he can help with things like
            DNA. However, when Rolo says that this is possible, but he came for
            something else, the defendant turns around and leaves, Rolo says
            "Think about your family”. Then the accused comes back and they
            talk. The defendant agrees to sell his consciousness to Rolo in case
            a death sentence is issued against him. The defendant convinces his
            family that this is only a reflection and when the death sentence is
            handed down against him, he sells his consciousness with his current
            pain in the electric death row. The prisoner has been the only
            survivor of the electric execution. But his consciousness is alive.
            Rolo says that on the day of the execution, justice was achieved.
            The "most important object" of the museum becomes the "most
            important part". Rolo projects him through a glass window into the
            cell, but since it's not enough for humans just to navigate, he
            reenacts the electric execution scene for 10 seconds. Incoming
            "visitors" perform electric execution by pulling the lever.

            The girl tells me that I skipped some parts of the story and says
            she needs to sit down, pulls up a chair and makes Rolo sit down.
            Rolo blushes, he can't breathe. The girl talks about the protests
            for the exoneration of the prisoner made by the prisoner's wife,
            mentions that people were bored when they realized that there was
            momentum, but the state would not do anything to exonerate the
            prisoner, but after these protests, people became conscious that no
            one came to the museum, only sick people, psychopaths and sadists
            came.

            >, Justice, Criticism of Criminal Proceedings, Punishment Policy:
            Rolo wants to take this criminal to the museum by thinking purely
            commercially. During all the conversations in the story, he says
            that the man is guilty, which is a striking criticism of how biased
            the justice system is against people with ethnic differences in
            America. With social prejudice, believing that a person is guilty is
            actually not a diabolical thing. For example, 2. In the story, it is
            said that the prisoner killed the reporter while the father was
            watching TV, and society and the courts are guided by the media, as
            they are still today. For criminal sanction in criminal proceedings,
            and especially for the death penalty in order to be able to give;
            the legal system must be perfect. But perfection cannot be expected
            where man is.

            The policy of punishing criminals should be condemned for the act he
            committed and should ensure that he learns lessons, as well as
            ensuring that people refrain from committing crimes. However,
            unfortunately, most economic crimes may have harsher penalties than
            the crime of Sexual Harassment, which perhaps affects a person very
            deeply, and this leads us to question the correctness of the
            punishment policy. Justice is unique, sacred and social. The
            provision of justice should be one of the sole objectives of the
            state. A society in which justice is not provided is unhealthy.
