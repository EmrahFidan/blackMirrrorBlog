            It ranges from racism to fear of extraterrestrials in science

            The episode "Men Against Fire" addresses this theme by focusing on
            how people are controlled and manipulated.The episode is set in the
            near future, and soldiers are assigned to destroy mutated people
            called "roaches". The soldiers have a technology that, thanks to
            their implants, makes the faces and bodies of these roaches
            invisible. Thanks to this, soldiers can easily kill roaches during
            operations called "clearance".

            The story is told through Stripe (Malachi Kirby), one of the
            soldiers. Stripe is taking part in the battle for the first time and
            has seen how terrible the roaches are at close range. However, at
            the end of his operations, Stripe loses his implant and afterwards
            finds out how different the facts are.

            When Stripe is taken to a center to repair his implant, he learns
            the truth here: the Roaches are not actually human, but they reveal
            them to the soldiers as "roach" through the implants. Thanks to
            these implants, soldiers see the roaches as enemies and make it
            easier to destroy them. In fact, although the roaches are human,
            they have been marginalized by society and made targets by being
            told that they should be killed.

            This section offers a deep critique of how people can be controlled
            and manipulated. Factors such as the implants of soldiers, the
            influence of the media, the thoughts of the majority of society make
            people ready to see and destroy as enemies. Therefore, the episode
            serves as a warning about how easily people can be manipulated.

            As a result, the episode "Men Against Fire" offers a deep critique
            of how people can be controlled. Factors such as the implants of
            soldiers, the influence of the media and the thoughts of society
            make people ready to see and destroy as enemies. The episode reminds
            us that we need to question people's systems of thought and be wary
            of manipulation. In addition, the episode also gives an important
            message about othering and discrimination Decoupling between people.
            A group of people like the Roaches are ostracized by society and it
            becomes acceptable for them to be killed. This is a problem that is
            still happening today, and the department aims to raise awareness
            about it.

            The episode also highlights how big a role technology plays in
            people's lives and how this technology can be abused. Implants
            prevent soldiers from seeing the truth, allowing them to act more
            effectively in combat. However, this use of technology prevents
            people from seeing the facts and makes them open to manipulation.
            The episode "Men Against Fire", as throughout the Black Mirror
            series, deals with a topic that bothers the viewer and sheds light
            on the dark aspects of human nature. The department creates
            awareness on social and ethical issues by processing the issues of
            how people can be controlled, manipulated and marginalized.
